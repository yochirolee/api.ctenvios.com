## Payment Status Flow

The order's `payment_status` is automatically updated based on the payment:

```
PENDING â†’ PARTIALLY_PAID â†’ PAID
```

| Status           | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`        | No payment received (paid_in_cents = 0)                    |
| `PARTIALLY_PAID` | Some payment received (0 < paid_in_cents < total_in_cents) |
| `PAID`           | Fully paid (paid_in_cents >= total_in_cents)               |

---

## Card Processing Fees

**Automatic Charge Calculation:**

When payment method is `CREDIT_CARD` or `DEBIT_CARD`, a 3% processing fee is automatically:

1. Calculated based on the payment amount
2. Added to the order total
3. Recorded in the payment record
4. Added to payment notes

**Configuration:**

```typescript
// src/config/payment.config.ts
export const PAYMENT_CONFIG = {
   CARD_PROCESSING_FEE_RATE: 0.03, // 3%
   MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT: 0.01,
   CENTS_MULTIPLIER: 100,
};
```

**Example:**

```json
// Request
{
  "amount_in_cents": 100000,  // $1,000.00
  "method": "CREDIT_CARD"
}

// Result
{
  "payment": {
    "amount_in_cents": 100000,  // $1,000.00
    "charge_in_cents": 3000,    // $30.00 (3% fee)
    "notes": "Card processing fee (3%): $30.00"
  },
  "order": {
    "total_in_cents": 103000,   // Original + fee
    "paid_in_cents": 100000     // Payment amount only
  }
}
```

## Business Rules

### âœ… Validations

1. **Amount Validation:**

   -  Must be greater than 0
   -  Cannot exceed remaining balance

2. **Order Status:**

   -  Order must exist
   -  Order cannot already be fully paid

3. **Payment Integrity:**
   -  All operations are atomic (transaction-safe)
   -  Payment and order update happen together or not at all

### ðŸ’¡ Features

1. **Automatic Fee Calculation:**

   -  Card payments automatically include 3% processing fee
   -  Fee is added to order total
   -  Fee is tracked separately in payment record

2. **Partial Payments:**

   -  Multiple payments can be made on the same order
   -  Payment status updates automatically
   -  Tracks total paid vs total amount

3. **Transaction Safety:**
   -  Uses database transactions
   -  Ensures data consistency
   -  Automatic rollback on errors

## Testing Examples

### Test Case 1: Successful Full Payment

```typescript
// Order total: $500.00
const paymentData = {
   amount_in_cents: 50000,
   method: "CASH",
};

// Expected Result:
// - payment_status: PAID
// - paid_in_cents: 50000
// - total_in_cents: 50000
```

### Test Case 2: Partial Payment

```typescript
// Order total: $500.00
const payment1 = {
   amount_in_cents: 30000, // $300
   method: "CASH",
};

// After first payment:
// - payment_status: PARTIALLY_PAID
// - paid_in_cents: 30000
// - total_in_cents: 50000

const payment2 = {
   amount_in_cents: 20000, // $200
   method: "CASH",
};

// After second payment:
// - payment_status: PAID
// - paid_in_cents: 50000
// - total_in_cents: 50000
```

### Test Case 3: Card Payment with Fee

```typescript
// Order total: $500.00
const paymentData = {
   amount_in_cents: 50000,
   method: "CREDIT_CARD",
};

// Expected Result:
// - payment_status: PARTIALLY_PAID (because of fee!)
// - paid_in_cents: 50000
// - total_in_cents: 51500 (50000 + 1500 fee)
// - charge_in_cents: 1500
```
