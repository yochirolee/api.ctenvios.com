# Artillery Database Foreign Key Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed
Artillery stress tests were failing with `P2003` foreign key constraint errors because they were using hardcoded customer and receiver IDs (1-200) that didn't exist in the database.

## Solution Implemented
Updated `artillery-processor.js` to fetch real customer, receiver, and user IDs from the database at startup, similar to how the Jest tests work with `TestDataGenerator`.

## Changes Made

### 1. artillery-processor.js
- **Added:** Prisma Client import and initialization
- **Added:** `initializeData()` async function that:
  - Fetches 50 real customers from database
  - Fetches 50 real receivers from database
  - Fetches 20 real users from agencies 1 & 2
  - Organizes users by agency ID
  - Validates data exists before running tests
- **Changed:** Replaced hardcoded ID arrays with database-populated arrays
- **Changed:** Removed `fallbackUsers` constant, now uses `sampleUsers` from database
- **Exported:** `initializeData` function for Artillery to call

### 2. All Artillery Config Files
Updated all 5 config files to initialize database data before running scenarios:
- artillery-test.yml
- artillery-light.yml
- artillery-ultra.yml
- artillery-endurance.yml
- artillery-spike.yml

**Added initialization scenario:**
```yaml
scenarios:
  # Initialize data from database before running any scenarios
  - name: "Initialize Database Data"
    weight: 1
    flow:
      - function: "initializeData"
```

### 3. YAML Indentation Fixed
Fixed all remaining indentation issues in config files to use consistent 2-space indentation.

## How It Works

1. **First Request:** When Artillery starts, it calls `initializeData()` which queries the database once
2. **Data Cached:** Customer, receiver, and user IDs are stored in module-level variables
3. **Subsequent Requests:** All test requests use real IDs from the cached arrays
4. **No More Foreign Key Errors:** All IDs are guaranteed to exist in the database

## Testing the Fix

Run the light test to verify:
```bash
yarn artillery:light
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸ”„ Initializing Artillery data from database...
âœ… Artillery data initialized:
   - Customers: 50
   - Receivers: 50
   - Users: 20
   - Agency 1 Users: X
   - Agency 2 Users: Y
```

Then you should see successful order creation with 200/201 status codes instead of P2003 errors.

## Benefits

1. âœ… No more foreign key constraint errors
2. âœ… Uses real production data for accurate testing
3. âœ… Automatically adapts to your database state
4. âœ… Clear error messages if data is missing
5. âœ… Consistent with Jest test approach

## Maintenance

If you need to regenerate the token or the tests start failing with 401 errors, run:
```bash
node generate-test-token.js
```

And update the Bearer token in all `.yml` files.
